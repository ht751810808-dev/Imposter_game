    <h1>📖 Imposter Game Rules - Complete Guide</h1>
    <p style="color: #aaa; font-size: 1.1rem;">Learn how to play imposter game like a pro</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-content">
    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>🎯 Game Overview</h2>
      <p>Imposter Game (also known as "Who is the Spy" or "Undercover") is a social deduction party game where players try to identify the impostor among them. Most players receive the same word (civilians), while one player receives a different but related word (the impostor).</p>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Game Objective:</strong><br>
        <strong>Civilians:</strong> Identify and vote out the impostor<br>
        <strong>Impostor:</strong> Blend in with civilians without being discovered
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>👥 Setup Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Players:</strong> 3-12 people (optimal: 5-8)</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> 5-15 minutes per round</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Just one device with our generator!</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 8+ (family-friendly)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>🎮 How to Play - Step by Step</h2>
      
      <h3>Phase 1: Setup (2 minutes)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all players in a circle or around a table</li>
        <li>Choose a game category (Food, Animals, Places, Objects, Movies, or Jobs)</li>
        <li>Enter the number of players and their names in our generator</li>
        <li>Click "Start Game" - the generator will randomly assign:
          <ul>
            <li>One word to the <strong>civilians</strong></li>
            <li>A different (but related) word to the <strong>impostor</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 2: Word Reveal (1-2 minutes)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Each player takes turns viewing their secret word <strong>privately</strong></li>
        <li>Players must <strong>memorize</strong> their word (no screenshots!)</li>
        <li>Keep your word <strong>completely secret</strong> from others</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>💡 Pro Tip:</h4>
        <p>Pass the device around with the screen facing down. Each player taps "Reveal Word" when it's their turn, looks at it, then taps "Next Player" before passing.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Phase 3: Discussion Round (5-8 minutes)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Each player gives a <strong>brief description</strong> of their word WITHOUT saying the word directly
          <ul>
            <li>Example: If your word is "Pizza", you might say: "It's round, has cheese, often delivered"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Players can ask questions to each other
          <ul>
            <li>"Is yours commonly found in homes?"</li>
            <li>"Would kids like yours?"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> More detailed descriptions (optional)</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>⚠️ Important Rules:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Never say your exact word</li>
          <li>Everyone must participate - no staying silent</li>
          <li>No showing or writing your word</li>
          <li>Listen carefully to others' descriptions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Phase 4: Voting (1 minute)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>After discussion, everyone votes for who they think is the impostor</li>
        <li>You can vote for anyone except yourself</li>
        <li>All players vote simultaneously (point fingers or use the app)</li>
        <li>The player with the most votes is eliminated</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 5: Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>If the impostor is voted out:</strong> Civilians win! 🎉</li>
        <li><strong>If a civilian is voted out:</strong> The impostor wins! 😈</li>
        <li>Reveal both words to all players</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>🎯 Strategy Guide</h2>
      
      <h3>For Civilians:</h3>
      <div class="tip-box">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be Specific Enough:</strong> Your description should prove you know the civilian word, but not give it away entirely</li>
          <li><strong>Watch for Vague Answers:</strong> The impostor will try to stay general - spot the pattern</li>
          <li><strong>Listen Carefully:</strong> Notice if someone's description doesn't quite fit</li>
          <li><strong>Build Trust:</strong> Use details that only someone with the same word would know</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinate:</strong> If you're confident someone else is a civilian, build on their descriptions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>For the Impostor:</h3>
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listen First:</strong> Let others speak before you - this helps you understand the civilian word</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Generic:</strong> Use descriptions that could apply to many things in the category</li>
          <li><strong>Mirror Others:</strong> Copy the style and tone of civilian descriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Don't Panic:</strong> Stay calm when questioned - hesitation is suspicious</li>
          <li><strong>Deflect Suspicion:</strong> If questioned, turn it around: "Why are you asking that?"</li>
          <li><strong>Blend In:</strong> Don't be too quiet or too talkative - match the group energy</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>🎨 Game Variations</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Clue Word Mode</h3>
      <p>Enable this mode in our generator for beginners. Players see a hint word related to the category (e.g., "Something you can eat" for Food category). Makes the game easier for new players!</p>

      <h3>2. Blank/White Card Mode</h3>
      <p>Add a "blank" player who receives NO word at all. They must survive without knowing either word. Advanced difficulty!</p>

      <h3>3. Speed Round</h3>
      <p>Limit discussion to 3 minutes total. Fast-paced and intense!</p>

      <h3>4. Multiple Impostors</h3>
      <p>For 8+ players, have 2 impostors with the same impostor word. They must identify each other subtly and work together.</p>

      <h3>5. Custom Words</h3>
      <p>Use our word list to pick specific pairs that have interesting relationships!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-section">
      <h2>❓ Common Questions</h2>
      
      <h3>Can the impostor win without speaking?</h3>
      <p>No! Everyone must participate. Complete silence is against the rules and too suspicious.</p>

      <h3>What if two players get the same number of votes?</h3>
      <p>Have a second round of discussion (1 minute) focusing only on those two players, then vote again.</p>

      <h3>Can players team up and whisper?</h3>
      <p>No private conversations! All discussion must be public to the group.</p>

      <h3>What if someone accidentally says their word?</h3>
      <p>That player is immediately revealed and eliminated. If they're the impostor, civilians win. If civilian, continue playing.</p>

      <h3>Can we play online via video call?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely! Share your screen during word reveal, or each player can use the generator on their own device.</p>
