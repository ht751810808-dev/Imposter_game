        <p><strong>Smart impostor plays that almost worked:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stayed vague about specific details</li>
          <li>Quickly agreed with others' descriptions</li>

        <h4>📊 Game Analysis</h4>
        <p><strong>Rachel's winning strategy:</strong></p>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Used technically true facts</strong> - tigers CAN climb, leopards DO have spots (though different pattern)</li>
          <li><strong>Name-dropped specific subspecies</strong> - "Bengal" and "Siberia" work for tigers, but leopards also have subspecies</li>
          <li><strong>Stayed calm under pressure</strong> - defended without getting defensive</li>
          <li><strong>Turned tables</strong> - questioned Oscar back, making HIM look suspicious</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why civilians lost:</strong></p>

          <li>Kate revealed too much early ("stripes, orange and black")</li>
